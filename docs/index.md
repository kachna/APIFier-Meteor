## About

JavaScript is here in full power and ruling the web (God save us!). Dynamic web pages are full of it and Node.js is backbone of many servers. I didn't choose it but I have to use it. It is time to stand up and face to JavaScript.

## APIFier

[APIFier](http://www.apifier.com) is service providing hosted crawlers for any purposes you can imagine. Crawlers are configured via simple JavaScript function which is injected to destination page. This concept let you manipulate complete DOM, extract all data presented on the page, scroll the page, control dynamic elements, fill and send forms even login and much more. See [Example crawlers](https://www.apifier.com/) on APIFierâ€‹'s homepage.
